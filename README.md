# Absenteeism-at-Work

It is a technical explanation of the Case Study’s structure.

 

### Data Preprocessing:

First, we will preprocess the data. We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.

### Machine Learning:

Based on Preprocessed data we will develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. For our case study, this will be a logistic regression model. Numerous machine learning tools and techniques will help us at this stage. At the end, we will store our work as a Python module that we will call ‘absenteeism_module’ and will thus preserve it in a form suitable for further analysis.

 
### Loading the ‘absenteeism_module’:

In this section we will load the ‘absenteeism_module’ and use its methods to obtain predictions.

 
### Analyzing the predicted outputs in Tableau:

Finally, we will use Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of our model. The visualizations we will obtain with this software will help us a great deal while looking for insights.
