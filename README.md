# Case Study: Absenteeism-at-Work


The exercise will adress Absentism at the company during work time.


Data: As a data source for our analysis, we will use Secondary data, which is real example, and data collection was done bla bla

Reasearch Question: We would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given work day.

Having such information in advance can improve our decision making how by reorganizing the work process in a way that will allow us to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated in our firm.

Definition of absenteeism: The absence from work during normal working hours resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity.



> Logically here comes some additional questions based on what information should we predict whether an employee is expected to be absent or not. How would we measure absenteeism.



> Should we rather think about trying to predict excessive absenteeism. We will answer these and other questions as we proceed with our analysis for the moment.



The purpose of the business exercise will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not. In other words we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from their workplace, how many children and pets they have, Do they have higher education and so on.



 

### Data Preprocessing:

First, we will preprocess the data. We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.

### Machine Learning:

Based on Preprocessed data we will develop a model that will predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work. For our case study, this will be a logistic regression model. Numerous machine learning tools and techniques will help us at this stage. At the end, we will store our work as a Python module that we will call ‘absenteeism_module’ and will thus preserve it in a form suitable for further analysis.

 
### Loading the ‘absenteeism_module’:

In this section we will load the ‘absenteeism_module’ and use its methods to obtain predictions.

 
### Analyzing the predicted outputs in Tableau:

Finally, we will use Tableau to analyse three separate dependencies between the inputs of our model. The visualizations we will obtain with this software will help us a great deal while looking for insights.
